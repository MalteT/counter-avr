# counter

This is a small program I wrote while learning some of the basics of programming an
AVR-based chip using Rust. The seven segment LED shows a number betreen 0 and 9. Upon
pressing the button an interrupt is fired that increments the shown number. The counter is
wrapping at 9, so that it continues at 0. I made an effort to make it overcomplicated by
storing the displayed digit in the non-volatile, internal EEPROM of the ATmega328P. Resetting
the mcu thus does not reset the counter itself!

## Hardware

The setup for this project consists of
 - an **ATmega328P** (or ATmega328, I guess)

   I'm using an Arduino, but this should work without one. Just lookup the PIN mapping from the
   mcu to the Arduino pins and change the circuit accordingly.
 - a **seven segment LED** (or seven leds, if that's what you have on hand)
 - a **pushbutton**
 - one **capacitor**, I think mine is 1nF
 - some (8) **resistors**, 220Œ© should do

   I also used a 1kŒ© resistor combined with the capacitor to create a simple debouncer. I think
   it was mainly luck that mine worked out of the box. There are a number of different
   techniques for creating the same effect.
 - some **wires/jumpers** and
 - a **breadboard**

## Wiring

Here is an image showing the wiring. But feel free to use the schematic below, if you can't
make out the connections.

Note that the seven segment LED part in Fritzing seems broken. The pins on the breadboard do
not match up with those shown in [this schematic][3].

If you're having trouble mapping your segments correctly, have a look at the [`Segments`
struct][4]. It's a mapping from each pin of the port to the name of the segment.

## Prerequisites
 - A recent version of the nightly Rust compiler. Anything including or greater than rustc 1.47.0-nightly (0820e54a8 2020-07-23) can be used.
 - The rust-src rustup component - `$ rustup component add rust-src`
 - AVR-GCC on the system for linking

## Compiling

To compile this program for the ATmega328p you can simply run `make build`.

## Uploading

I'm using [avrdude][5] to upload the compiled ELF-file, simply run `make`.
If your serial port differs from `/dev/ttyACM0` overwrite it like this:
```console
$ make PORT=/dev/yourport
```

## The progam

I tried to do some heavy commenting, to enable everyone to learn from this example. Now,
there are some really ugly parts and some of the unsafe code could, and might, be rewritten
in a safer way, but if you want to have a look, follow the white rabbit [üêá][6]
