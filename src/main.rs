//! This is a small program I wrote while learning some of the basics of programming an
//! AVR-based chip using Rust.
//!
//! If you're interested in learning the basics, check out the
//! [AWESOME list](https://github.com/avr-rust/awesome-avr-rust) about where to start.
//!
//! # Hardware
//!
//! The setup for this project consists of
//!  - an ATmega328P (or ATmega328, I guess)
//!
//!    I'm using an Arduino, but this should work without one. Just lookup the PIN mapping from the
//!    mcu to the Arduino pins and change the circuit accordingly.
//!  - a seven segment LED (or seven leds, if that's what you have on hand)
//!  - a pushbutton
//!  - one capacitor, I think mine is 1nF
//!  - some (9) resistors, 220Ω should do
//!
//!    I also used a 1kΩ resistor combined with the capacitor to create a simple debouncer. I think
//!    it was mainly luck that mine worked out of the box. There are a number of different
//!    techniques for creating the same effect.
//!  - some wires/jumpers and
//!  - a breadboard
//!
//! # Wiring
//!
//! Here is an image showing the wiring. But feel free to use the schematic below, if you can't
//! make out the connections.
